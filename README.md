# Next.js + Styled Components Minimal\* Boilerplate

Found myself repeating this setup process several times when starting a new project so I decided to just make a simple boilerplate to use instead.

## **\***Private Clone**\*\*\***

### **Includes:**

- CSS Reset
- Global styles
- Starter menu
- Basic theme config
- Absolute imports (@components, @utils, etc.)
- Minor styling
- React 17, Next 12, Styled Components 5
